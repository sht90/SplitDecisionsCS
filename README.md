# Split Decisions

Another attempt at Split Decisions

## Purpose

Split Decisions is easily my favorite word puzzle, and one of my favorite puzzles in general. It was originally invented by George Bredehorn, and currently made almost exclusively by Fred Piscop. Please see [Mr. Piscop's personal website](http://www.split-decisions.us/) for more details about Split Decisions puzzles.

My goal with this repository is to be able to generate Split Decisions puzzles, so that I can print them out and attempt to solve them.

## Dictionaries

Many programs within this repository process large text files. I'm omitting these files from this repository, but typically there are two dictionaries that I use:

* [10,000 most common words in the English Language](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)
* [Every word in the English Language](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
